## 🙋‍♂️ Why ?

A lot of components library are already shipped with styles but as a Front End developer, I always wants to override a lot. Futhermore, there are not always accessible or they are shipped with jQuery.

There are some good library like [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html) but it's made to work on one framework and I work on different tech like Wordpress, Symfony or VueJS.

> This library provide only the compotes and it's you to make a tart.
