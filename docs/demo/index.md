# Demo

Compotes provides minimum styles, so some CSS is added to make it work with the CSS provided by the documentation (VitePress).

Demo are made with the [VueJS components](/guide/vue/components) of the library.

You can check directly [the source code of the documentation](https://github.com/Applelo/compotes/tree/main/docs/demo) for more details.
