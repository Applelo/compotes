# Demo

Compotes provides minimum styles, so some CSS is added to make it work with the CSS provided by the documentation (VitePress).

Demo are made with the Vanilla JS version of the library and encapsulated with VueJS.

You can check directly [the source code of the documentation](https://github.com/Applelo/compotes/tree/main/docs/demo) for more details.
