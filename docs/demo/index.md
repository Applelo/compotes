# Demo

Compotes provides minimal styles, so additional CSS has been added for the demos to integrate with VitePress styling.

Demos are made with the [VueJS components](/guide/vue/components) of the library.

You can check directly [the source code of the documentation](https://github.com/Applelo/compotes/tree/main/docs/demo) for more details.
