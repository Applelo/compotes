# Get started

A lot of components library are already shipped with styles but as a Front End developer, I always wants to override a lot. Futhermore, there are not always accessible or they are shipped with jQuery.

There are some good library like React Aria but it's made to work on one framework and I work on different tech like Wordpress, Symfony or VueJS.

> This library provide only the compotes and it's you to make a tart.


## Installation

### Vanilla JS

```shell
# pnpm
pnpm add -D compotes

#npm
npm i -D compotes

# yarn
yarn add -D compotes
```
